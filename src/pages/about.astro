  <ContentSection title="Our Approach to Learning">
    <p>
      At Kids Kave Junior School, we offer a modern, holistic education that goes
      beyond textbooks. While we follow the UNEB curriculum for our primary
      section, we enrich learning through practical subjects such as agriculture,
      creative activities, and the use of modern teaching aids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to nurture well-rounded learners — confident, curious,
      disciplined, and equipped with the skills needed to face modern-day
      challenges.

  <ContentSection title="Nursery & Primary Education">
    <p>
      Our nursery program focuses on early childhood development through
      play-based learning, creativity, and guided exploration. We help young
      learners build strong foundations in communication, confidence, and
      independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our primary school follows the UNEB curriculum while emphasizing strong
      academic performance, critical thinking, practical life skills, and
      discipline. Learners are guided to become responsible and self-motivated
      individuals.

  <ContentSection title="Values-Based, Inclusive Education">
    <p>
      Kids Kave Junior School is a values-based but non-denominational institution.
      We promote respect, integrity, responsibility, and kindness while welcoming
      families from all backgrounds. We believe character development is just as
      important as academic success.

  <ContentSection title="Supporting Busy Parents">
    <p>
      We understand the needs of the modern, busy parent. In addition to quality
      education, we offer daycare services to ensure children are well cared for
      in a safe and supportive environment while parents attend to their daily
      commitments.

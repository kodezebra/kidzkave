    <p>
      In our primary section, we follow the UNEB curriculum, providing structured
      academic learning that emphasizes literacy, numeracy, science, and social
      studies. Learners are encouraged to develop discipline, responsibility, and
      independent thinking.

  <ContentSection title="Holistic & Practical Learning">
    <p>
      Beyond classroom learning, we integrate agriculture and practical life
      skills into our program. These experiences help learners understand their
      environment, develop responsibility, and apply knowledge in real-world
      contexts.
